# SpaceSquad

Spacesquad is a cooperative multiplayer game who shout technobabble at each other until their ship explodes. Each player needs a laptop device. It can also be played in single player mode.

You'll be assigned a random control panel with buttons. You need to follow time-sensitive instructions. However, the instructions are being sent to your teammates, so you have to coordinate before the time runs out. Also, the space-ship is falling apart. And you're trying to outrun an exploding star.

Follow the commands before time runs out!
